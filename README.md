# PSC FRAM Admin

Welcome to the repository of administration tools used the PSC Coho Technical Committee (CoTC) with the Fisheries Regulation Assessment Model (FRAM)

**NOTE:**  You will not find any reports or data used by the technical committee to produce reports or run the model.  This repository is strictly limited to providing utilities and tools to facility on going work by the committee and share those tools with people outside of the committee memebership.

This repository is very new and immature, so expect the structure and how to carry out different functions to change over time.

## Required Software

As these utilities are written in R, you must have [R installed](https://www.r-project.org/).  If you have R installed, the scripts should automatically install the required packages for each utility.  

## Help Files

* [Annual Report Help](/doc/annual-report-readme.md)
* [Import File Help](/doc/import-file-readme.md)

2) Update your own fork (git pull)

3) Work, edit, make changes: (git add -> git commit -> git push)
