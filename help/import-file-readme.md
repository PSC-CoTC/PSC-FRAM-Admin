# Import File Readme

This document describes how to create import file templates and import data into a FRAM model run.  The main purpose of the import template function is to clearly split up responsibilities around updating catch values within a FRAM model run.

## Create Import Files

Import files can initially be created from an existing FRAM model run, typically the post-season run.  As the FRAM database name, run name, and run ID are within the import file template, the files must be created from the same run database and model run that the catch values are to be updated.  You can use the template file to update values within another model run, but the header information within the import template file must be modified.

To create the import files, you must first configure the `"CreateImportFiles"` by editing the `"create_import_config.r"` in the `"config"` folder.  In that file you set the following variables using R language syntax.  The variables :

* `fram.db.name` should be set to the FRAM database file name, include path if needed.
* `fram.run.name` is the name of the FRAM run that you would like to create the import files for.

With the `create_import_config.r` file configured, you can then run the `CreateImportFiles.bat` command line script by double clicking it.  This will create separate import files for each person identified as a catch source in the `data\PersonFramFisheries.csv` file.  All the import files are written to the `report` folder. Note, if the .bat file does not work properly, check that the version of R you are running is listed in the `./bin/setup.bat` script.

## Modify Import Files

Once the import files are created, they can be distributed to individual people.  Generally speaking, the fisheries and time steps identified in the individual import files should not be modified because of two possible outcomes:

* Catch values may override values provided by other import files
* Catch values may not be used by FRAM because they don't align with the base period


### Fishery Flag Values

Fishery Flag | Description 
------------ | -------------
 1 | Non-Selective fishery based on base period scalar (not for use with Post Season catch) 
 2 | Non-Selective fishery based on quota (**use this to set final fishery catch**) 
 7 | Mark-Selective fishery based on base period scalar (not for use with Post Season catch) 
 8 | Mark-Selective fishery based on quota (**use this to set final fishery catch**) 
 17 | Non-Selective and Mark-Selective fishery based on base period scalar (not for use with Post Season catch) 
 18 | Non-Selective base period scalar and Mark-Selective quota fishery (not for use with Post Season catch) 
 27 | Non-Selective quota and Mark-Selective base period scalar fishery (not for use with Post Season catch) 
 28 | Non-Selective and Mark-Selective fishery based on quota (**use this to set final fishery catch**) 

### Escapement Flag Values
Escapement Flag | Description
--------------- | -------------
0 | Use pre-season number
1 | Use entered exact number
2 | split into unmarked/marked from pre-season ratio

## Update FRAM Post-Season Model Run with Import File

Once the import files have been updated, they can be imported back into the model run through `ImportPostSeasonFile.bat` command.  This command validates the file and updates the database if no validation rules are broken.

Note: The import file is validated for use as a post-season catch data set for backward FRAM.  This mainly consists of checking fishery flags against non-selective and mark selective catch.

## Validation of Post-Season Catch Values

As part of importing post-season catch value files, several validation steps are run against the file.  The validation steps are all configurable using a TRUE/FALSE flag within the `"config\import_post_season_config.r"` file.  The following validation steps are carried out.

Validation Config Variable | Description 
------------ | -------------
 `validate.catch` | Checks that the flags are appropriately set for the catches provided (e.g. nonselective/mark-selective fisheries)
 `validate.fisheries` | Checks that all the fisheries are represented in the import file for the person responsible
 `validate.mark.info` |  Checks that mark rate information is provided if a mark-selective fishery is identified
